## Introduction
These code examples are intended to demonstrate the main building blocks of peer-to-peer comunications in go-ethereum. They are organized in chapters, where every example in a chapter builds on the next.

They form the basis for a tutorial with a detailed simple-to-follow narrative. This tutorial is currently being written/

Please note that the texts are still in draft status, and may contain omissions, typos, shitty language and most certainly bad formatting. They is written in `latex`, but for convenience a README.md file will be generated with each update of the texts. It will be auto-generated by `pandoc` and may contain unparsed directives. It will stay that way until the document is complete, where proper builds will be made available.

## Requirements
Golang >= 1.20


## USING THESE EXAMPLES

```
go run <filename> [-v]
```

## Contents

### A - Lowlevel devp2p

p2p server is the core structure for communications between nodes. It creates and maintains ip connections between nodes, and embeds p2p encryption with RLP serialization (RLPx) on the data connection.

* A1_Server.go 

  Initializing and starting the p2p Server

* A2_Connect.go

  Connecting two p2p Servers

* A3_Events.go

  Receiving notification of completed connection

* A4_Message.go

  Sending a message from server A to server B

* A5_Reply.go

  A sample p2p ping protocol implementation

### B - Remote Procedure Calls

* Comming Soon

### C - Service node

This entity encapsulates the p2p server and the RPC call APIs, in packages called "services." A Node.Service is defined as an interface, and objects of this interface are registered with the node, and automatically started in alphabetical order when the service node is started.
